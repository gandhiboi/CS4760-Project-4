ISSUES

- could not figure out how to wait for remaining blocked processes to finish if they spawn before the time is up; so
  I included a cleanup function to kill the remaining blocked processes; only happens with processes that spawn after 90
- could not figure out why for some reason the local pid and pid after the process is unblocked is shown as zero for both
- sometimes the program will stop and wait for a message and terminates due to the timer; rarely happens but can just
  rerun the program and it will work
- included a while loop because the child would terminate too quickly and message would not be received by oss
- had to increase the default timer to 5 seconds because it would not finish fast enough due to the loop mentioned in the
  comment above
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HOW TO RUN

1. Type 'make' in the terminal
2. Run as './oss' followed by the options and name of the log file; if no options are
   specified, then defaults will be provided [-s 5] [-l output.log] are defaults
 
   e.g. ./oss -s 4 -l output.log

3. Type 'make clean' to remove executables, object files, and log file
